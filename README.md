# Flipkart-Order-Scrapper
This is the code for a personal hobby project.
This code makes a user login into the flipkart account using Chrome automation and then scrape the orders of that user and convert it into pandas dataframe with date title, category, status of order, and price. 
Further, the dataframe is converted to csv file and stored as a new database into system.
